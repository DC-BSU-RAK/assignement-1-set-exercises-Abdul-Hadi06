      <h3>My Review:</h3>
      <p>
        As a viewer, I honestly really enjoyed watching Friends. I didn’t expect to like it this much at first because it’s an old show but I ended up loving it. The characters are all different in their own way and it’s fun to see how their friendships grow over time. Like, if we talk about Chandler, he is one of my favorite characters because of his jokes and also Joey, who always makes me laugh. The show is easy to watch and some episodes are really emotional.
        What I really like about Friends is the setting. The coffee shop and Monica’s apartment make it feel like you’re part of the group. It’s the kind of place where we’d like to hang out with our friends. This adds to the charm and makes the show even more enjoyable to watch.
        When I first started watching Friends I wasn’t sure what to expect but I quickly got hooked. It’s not just the jokes that make it great, it’s the way the characters grow together and handle life’s challenges. Each character has something unique about them making it easy to relate to and enjoy. The show balances comedy with deeper and more serious moments. It’s not just about laughs, it also explores love, career struggles and personal growth which makes it feel real.
        No doubt, so many people still talk about it and even watch it these days. Personally, I think 9.5 out of 10 is totally fair for how much I enjoyed the series. Friends is one of those shows you can watch again and again without getting bored, always finding something new to enjoy. It’s easy to see why people still love it, even after all these years.
